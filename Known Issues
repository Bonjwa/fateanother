DISCLAIMER : The game is still in beta version and is going through bugfix, gameplay and particle improvement. I am quite sure all game-breaking bugs are already addressed, but do visit googledoc and leave a report if you find one.


Useful Commands

-bgmon/-bgmoff : Turns BGM on/off. 
-goldpls : Pops a message to request gold from your teammates
-(playerID) (goldamount) : Sends gold to the player with specified ID. The player ID is not 1-5 for one team and 6-10 for another, but -goldpls shows player ID of hero in need of gold.


FAQ

Q) I started the game, but the hero is frozen!
A) All heroes are paused until game starts, which is around 1:15 to 1:20. If they are still frozen after then, do report the bug.

Q) I got stat requirements and combo sequence correct, but I cannot use combo?
A) It is most likely that you queued your ability without realizing that the ability swaps to combo upon detecting combo sequence. Please allow a bit of time before last input.
If that's not the case, report the bug in googledoc.

Q) Where can I finish my Master unit?
A) Right bottom side of the map.

Q) How do I buy items with hotkey?
A) You move through column with QWER and select a row with 1~9 button. This is quite terrible I know.

Q) Can I change camera zoom?
A) No, in Dota 2 all players' camera vision range is bound to one variable, meaning everyone will be forced to use your zoom. 

Q) Why does transfering a component from stash move other components altogether? I keep making EX by mistake =(
A) This is because of how Dota 2 item combination works. I am currently trying to find a workaround for this. 

This list goes over the bugs that I have no control over:
