--- Attributes
Hunter's Mark
Each stack of Calydonian Hunt debuff will provide 10% extra damage from arrows (e.g. 5 stacks means 50% extra damage).
Bonus debuff duration: 3s

Gift of Artemis
Tauropolos: Bow of Heaven buff provides 200 extra range to Q arrows and 100 extra AoE to arrows which use AoE (affects combo as well)

Crossing Arcadia+
Crossing Arcadia now fires 3 arrows instead of 1. The arrows are fired in a triangular formation such that a unit directly below Atalanta will be hit by all 3 of them. Units to the side can be hit by 2 depending on where they are standing.

Arrows of the Goddess
Increases Celestial Arrow's range by 100 and arrows now provide vision.

--- Numbers
50 mana into damage and 50 into agi gives 200 damage, plus passive damage from Q goes to +250 damage.
Expected ~320 base damage max.
5 arrows + 150% bonus damage from Hunter's mark = 2000 damage
Landing 5 arrows from Q needs 4 seconds at max attack speed
10 arrows + 400% from Hunter's mark = ~4500 damage (too many arrows for target version?)
More burst comes from E where 3 arrows hit at once
3 arrows + 150% bonus damage = 1440 damage (Maybe too much? Can lower max stacks on buff)
Mana issues if nothing invested into Int

At base, using R gives 1s cooldown on Q (4 casts at lvl 1), frenzy gives 1.4s, frenzy + R gives 0.9s
Hard to decrease cooldown since each point of Agi only reduces it by 0.05s
Frenzy scrolls will be important when R is on cooldown

--- Thoughts
Different take on physical damage dealer (I think physical damage builds need to be balanced some time in the future)
Q Spam makes it difficult to cross bridge against her, and easy for her team to cross bridge, but low cooldown is needed
Have to manage putting stats into managing mana, attack speed and attack damage
Maybe too weak in early game? Each Q will do 100 damage but long cooldown and downtime (can lower R cooldown or increase duration)

Quark mentioned Q and mark concept is similar to Tamamo's Soulstream and charms (playstyle would be different otherwise?)

Skill synergies
C - Q - W - Q - S - Q (bread and butter)
C scroll - Q - W - E (W root allows time for E to land)
Q - R - W - Combo target version (W gives vision for target)
R - W - Combo barrage version - E (Jump when marble end)
