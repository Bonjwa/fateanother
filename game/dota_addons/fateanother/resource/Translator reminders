Tooltips contain large amount of HTML tags and newline characters(e.g \n, <font color='#58ACFA'></font>), so be careful.

If you encounter 'Master Mana Cost' in Attribute string(e.g <font color='#58ACFA'>Master Mana Required : 10</font>\n), please remove them. It is obsolete.

You might find deprecated abilities or Attributes(e.g DOTA_Tooltip_Ability_lancelot_attribute_total_assault). Ignore them.

If you want to check your tooltip in-game, you may ask me to test it or grab your own copy of mod and run it on local machine with your translation in game/resource/addon_(your language).txt(e.g addon_schinese.txt). Note that you will need to install Dota 2 modding tools on your local machine to run the game on your own.
