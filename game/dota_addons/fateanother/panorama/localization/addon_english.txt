All Servants possess deadly Noble Phantasms that are far more powerful than your regular Dota 2 abilities, meaning that getting out of position without countermeasure means certain death, just like CS:GO."
	"Fateanother_Servant_2"	"Fortunately, you can avoid or withstand most sticky situations with fast reflexes. The items are extrmely versatile from defense to utility, but they are all comsumables. In other words, there is no item difference that broadens the gap between the 'feed' and 'fed'; the only thing matters is your skill."

	"Fateanother_Master"		"MASTER"

	"Fateanother_Master_2"		"2. Cast Command Seal, giving immediate advantage to Servant such as healing them to full health and resetting their cooldowns.(Costs Master's Mana AND Health)"
	"Fateanother_Master_3"		"3. Purchase items and transfer them to Servant."

	"Fateanother_Tip_Header"					"REMINDER FOR BEGINNERS"
	"Fateanother_Tip01"							"1. As mentioned above, everything in the game is way more deadly than your regular Dota 2 abilities. Fast reflexes and well-timed use of defensive items(namely Blink Scroll, A Scroll, and B Scroll) are vital to survival."
	"Fateanother_Tip02"							"2. Fatepedia is a great resource for finding out what Servants do, from their abilities to strength/weaknesses."
	"Fateanother_Tip03"							"3. To practice your mechanics in sandbox mode, you may create a solo lobby with cheat enabled. Most of Dota 2 cheats also work in this game. For instance, -createhero legion creates Saber under your command."
